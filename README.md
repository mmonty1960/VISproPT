# VISproPT
VISproPT is the innovative instrument created at ENEA-Casaccia (Italy) for measuring the 3D shape of parabolic-trough (PT) panels for CSP solar collectors.
The zipped file RGinterior#58.7z contains the sequence of images acquired with the two cameras of VISproPT for an exemplary PT inner panel for LS3 solar collectors, as well as the configuration txt file containing the main instrument parameters.
